# DeepLearning
All model that use DeepLearning

#### first model related to recommendation system
  It is content-base and include DataManipulation, Data Modeling, Clustering, Reducing dimension, data visualization
  The main process use Deep learning for content-base recommendation system and after it finished use the output matrix for each separated model to find similarity and after that using the hierarchy to find the cluster number and after that run K-means to add cluster number for graphing after reducing dimension to three
